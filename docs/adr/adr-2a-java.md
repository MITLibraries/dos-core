# Software Stack

## Context

As DOS will be an important piece of our collections platform,
the software stack (web server, application container, programming language, database)
DOS uses to realize core functionality and to fulfill non-functional requirements 
of scalability, performance, reliability, security, and backward compatibility needs to be robust. Java can help meet 
various implicit non-functional requirements out of the box. The use of existing
mature Java ecosystem libraries can help meet the functional requirements easily.

## Decision

The core service will rely on Java and Spring framework as the basic stack for core services. 
 

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

As most DLS engineers are not proficient in Java or JVM languages, training may need to be provided to 
other team members so that they can assist the team if necessary.  In addition to extensive documentation, 
the project team plans to train additional the developers when we have the capacity in DLS and provide ensure 
operational coverage.
