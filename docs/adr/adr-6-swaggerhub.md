# SwaggerHub for API Documentation

## Context

We need a place to document the API. In future, functionality will likely be needed to manage access to this API.

## Decision

SwaggerHub will be used for documenting the API specification.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

In future, functionality will likely be needed to manage access to this API. Once the API management platform
becomes available, the API will need to be moved to the tool.
